The [UCL Centre for Advanced Research
Computing](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing) is hosting a 4-day
Julia for High-Performance Computing (HPC) training course, **from February 13th
to February 16th 2024**.
This is an **in-person event only**, and **[registration](#registration) is mandatory**, as we have limited capacity in the rooms allocate for the workshop.

[Julia](https://julialang.org/) is a modern dynamic programming language,
particularly well suited for numerical computing and HPC.  Starting from the
fundamentals of the language, the workshop will go into the details of how to
effectively write high-performance code in Julia using task-based
multi-threading, distributed computing and MPI, while also avoiding common
pitfalls.  Attendees will also learn how to offload computations to NVIDIA GPUs
in Julia.

The event is supported by UCL ARC through the [Fostering International
Collaborations in Advanced Digital
Research](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/fostering-international-collaborations-advanced-digital-research)
programme.  Computing resources are provided by the [Paderborn Center for
Parallel Computing (PC²)](https://pc2.uni-paderborn.de/) and the [NHR
Alliance](https://www.nhr-verein.de/).

## Venue

The workshop will be hosted at the **UCL Institute of Education** in London, UK.
See the [Venue](venue) page for more details.

## Instructors

* [Dr. Carsten Bauer](instructors/carsten-bauer/) (Paderborn Center for Parallel Computing)
* [Dr. Mosè Giordano](instructors/mose-giordano/) (UCL ARC)

## Material

The learning material for the workshop will be made publicly available.
We will provide a link in this page after the workshop.

## Registration

[Register](https://buytickets.at/uclarc/1086021/r/ws) via the button at the bottom of
this page.  There is no registration fee.

**Update (2024-01-30)**: Registration is now closed.

### Travel support

We have limited availability to **fund travel** of people who would not otherwise
be able to attend the workshop.  We can provide refund for travel, accommodation
and subsistence for attendees based outside of London.  In any case refund is
limited to **£1,000 per person** and will have to follow UCL Expenses policy,
get in touch with the organisers for more details.  We particularly welcome
applications from people belonging to underrepresented groups (e.g. gender,
ethnicity, etc.) in the numerical computing and HPC domains.  The outcome of
this application will be notified by the end of December 2023.

**Update (2023-12-21)**: we are no longer taking applications for travel support
and have selected the people who will receive it.

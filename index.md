[Julia](https://julialang.org/) is a modern dynamic programming language,
particularly well suited for numerical and computing.  The [UCL Centre for
Advanced Research Computing](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing)
is hosting a 4-day Julia for High-Performance Computing (HPC) workshop, **from
February 13th to February 16th 2024**.  Last day of the workshop will end by
14:00.

## Venue

The workshop will be hosted at the UCL Institute of Education in London, UK.
See the [Location](location) page for more details.

## Instructors

* [Dr. Carsten Bauer](speakers/carsten-bauer/) (Paderborn Center for Parallel Computing)
* [Dr. Mosè Giordano](speakers/mose-giordano/) (UCL ARC)

## Programme

A more detailed programme will be published in due course.
The following topics will be covered:

* **Julia fundamentals**
  * Multiple dispatch
  * Code specialization
  * Workflow (on HPC clusters)
* **Performance programming**
  * Type (in-)stability & memory optimizations
  * Instruction-level parallelism (SIMD)
  * Profiling
* **Parallelisation**
  * Task-based multithreading
  * Distributed computing (Distributed.jl and MPI.jl)
  * Basic GPU programming

## Target audience

Students and researchers who are interested in numerical computing who want to
learn how to write high-performance code using the Julia programming language.

## Prerequisites

Attendees are expected to have basic programming experience and familiarity with
UNIX/Linux environments.  Previous experience with the Julia language and/or HPC
programming and environments is beneficial, but not required.

## Registration

You can register for this event on Ticket Tailor.
There is no registration fee.

### Travel support

We have limited availablity to **fund travel** of students or early-career
researchers who would not be otherwise able to attend the workshop.  We can
provide refund for travel, accommodation in London and subsistence.  In any case
refund is limited to **£1,000 per person** and will have to follow UCL Expenses
policy, get in touch with the organisers for more details.  **Note**: this is
not available for people based in London, e.g. UCL students and members of
staff.

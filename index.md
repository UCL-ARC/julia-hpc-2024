The [UCL Centre for Advanced Research
Computing](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing) is hosting a 4-day
Julia for High-Performance Computing (HPC) training course, **from February 13th
to February 16th 2024**.

[Julia](https://julialang.org/) is a modern dynamic programming language,
particularly well suited for numerical and high-performance computing.  Starting
from the fundamentals of the language, the workshop will go into the details of
how to effectively write high-performance code in Julia using task-based
multi-threading, distributed computing and MPI, while also avoiding common
pitfalls.  Attendees will also learn how to offload computations to NVIDIA GPUs
in Julia.

## Venue

The workshop will be hosted at the **UCL Institute of Education** in London, UK.
See the [Venue](venue) page for more details.

## Instructors

* [Dr. Carsten Bauer](instructors/carsten-bauer/) (Paderborn Center for Parallel Computing)
* [Dr. Mosè Giordano](instructors/mose-giordano/) (UCL ARC)

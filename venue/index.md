## UK visa

If you are coming from outside of the UK and don't have British citizenship, you
may need a UK visa to enter the country.  Check on the [UK government
website](https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa) whether you need a visa for short
academic activities in the UK.  Up to February 2024, EU, EEA and Swiss citizens
should not require a visa for short-term visits.  Unfortunately we will not be
able to support visa applications this time.

## Getting to London

### Via train

If you arrive to London on railway, you will likely stop in one of the stations
in the central area of the city, and then you can move from there using [public
transport](#public-transport).  Note that London is also connected to
continental Europe by the [Eurostar service](https://www.eurostar.com/), which
offers an easier and greener alternative to flying.  There are direct trains to
London from Belgium, France, Germany, and the Netherlands.

### Via flight

London is served by [six international
airports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airports_of_London).  The most popular
one is Heathrow, located in the West end of London, and connected to the city by
the Piccadilly Underground line, the new [Elizabeth
Line](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/elizabeth-line/), and the [Heathrow
Express](https://www.heathrowexpress.com/) to Paddington train station.  The
Picaddilly line is the cheapest, but also slowest, option, the Heathrow Express
is the most expensive solution, but also the fastest one especially if your
final destination is near Paddington.

[Gatwick](https://www.gatwickairport.com/transport-options/to-from-london.html),
[Luton](https://www.london-luton.co.uk/to-and-from-lla), and
[Stansted](https://www.stanstedairport.com/getting-to-and-from/) airports are
served by many low-cost companies, and are connected to London by trains and/or
bus services, check their websites for more information.

## Public transport

The UCL IoE is in the heart of London, in the Borough of Camden.  London has
good public transport, most convenient means to move around in central London
include buses and the underground system, also known as the Tube.  The UCL IoE
is well connected with the rest of London, the underground stations of Russell
Square (on the Piccadilly line), Euston Square (on the Metropolitan, Hammersmith
& City, and Circle lines), Euston (on the Norther and Victoria lines), and
Goodge Street (on the Northern line) are all within 10-15 minutes walking from
the venue.  If coming from outside of London, nearby train stations include
Euston, and King's Cross & St. Pancras.  See the [Transport for
London (TfL) website](https://tfl.gov.uk/) for more information.

On all transports managed by TfL you can pay with your contactless (debit or
credit) card.  Should your card not be accepted by the card reader, you can buy an
[Oyster card](https://oyster.tfl.gov.uk/).  We do ***not*** recommend buying
individual paper tickets, as that would cost you more than using contactless or
Oyster cards, this option is even [discouraged by
TfL](https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/how-to-pay-and-where-to-buy-tickets-and-oyster/single-and-return-tickets).
You pay for the travels by [touching in and
out](https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/how-to-pay-and-where-to-buy-tickets-and-oyster/pay-as-you-go/touching-in-and-out)
your card on a yellow card reader at the start and at the end of your travel
(only at the start on buses and trams).

## Accommodation

Accommodation in London can be very expensive, especially close to the UCL
campus which is in the central part of the city, but there are also plenty of
cheaper options available. We don't recommend any particular solution, but you
can for example look on travel agencies websites like booking.com and filter the
results by price to match your budget.  Note that if you move a bit further away
from the UCL campus you can typically find cheaper deals, and still conveniently
reach the venue via [public transport](#public-transport).  A commute time of up
to 30 minutes is often considered to be reasonable.

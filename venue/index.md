## Public transport in London

The UCL IoE is in the heart of London, in the Borough of Camden.  London has
good public transport, most convenient means to move around in central London
include buses and the underground system, also known as the Tube.  The UCL IoE
is well connected with the rest of London, the underground stations of Russell
Square (on the Piccadilly line), Euston Square (on the Metropolitan, Hammersmith
& City, and Circle lines), Euston (on the Norther and Victoria lines), and
Goodge Street (on the Northern line) are all within 10-15 minutes walking from
the venue.  If coming from outside of London, nearby train stations include
Euston, and King's Cross & St. Pancras.  See the [Transport for
London](https://tfl.gov.uk/) website for more information.

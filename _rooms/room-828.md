This room is located on Level 8 of the [UCL Institute of Education](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/about-ioe/contact-ioe/visitor-accessibility).
After entering the IoE from the entrance located at 20 Bedford Way, turn right to go towards the lifts (or the stairs in front of them, if you prefer) and go to the 8th floor.
Once there, you will find two corridors: follow the one on the right (towards Core A) until you reach room 828, on your left.
